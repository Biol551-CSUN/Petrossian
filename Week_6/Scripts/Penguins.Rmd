# Intro

Today we are going to work with the penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*. 

# Load Libraries
```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

# Inspect the Data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a Plot

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% #using penguin dataset
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, #setting x axis as bill length
             y = bill_depth_mm, #setting y axis as bill depth
             color = species))+ #setting color as species
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")+
  theme_bw()
```
